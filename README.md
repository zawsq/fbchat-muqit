**fbchat-muqit** An Unofficial Asynchronous Facebook Messenger API designed to interact with Facebook and Messenger. It is an early release. Most of the feautures are not available yet. 
As It is an Unofficial API we are not responsible if you get banned by Facebook. We recommend to use a dummy Facebook account.

pip install fbchat-muqit

```


## üìô Documentation

The API is not fully documented yet [Read Documentation](http://fbchat-muqit.rtfd.io/)

## üìñ Usage Example

‚Ä¢ Usage Requirements:
- A Facebook account (It's safer to use new account)
- Facebook account cookies üç™



To login in Facebook you will need Facebook account cookies. Since login via email and password is no longer supported. 

To get your Facebook account cookies. First login in your Facebook account and then add [C3C Chrome extension](https://github.com/c3cbot/c3c-ufc-utility) in your browser. Open a your Facebook account in a browser tab and use this extension to get your account cookies. Copy the cookies and save them in a json file. We will use the cookies to interact with Facebook server.

A basic example of How to use it.

```python
import asyncio
from fbchat_muqit import Client, ThreadType

async def main():
    cookies_path = "path to json cookies file"
    # Lets login in Facebook
    bot = await Client.startSession(cookies_path)
    if await bot.isLoggedIn():

        """Lets send a Message to a friend when Client is logged in."""
                                        # put a valid fb user id
        await bot.sendMessage("I'm Online!", "10000072727288", ThreadType.USER)
        print("Logged in as", bot.uid)
    # listen to all incoming events
    await bot.listen()

# Windows User uncomment below two lines
# if sys.platform.startswith("win"):
#   asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(asyncio.WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy())
asyncio.run(main())

```

Save the code and now run it. 

```bash
python3 test.py
```
If It logins successfully then It will send a message to the given Facebook User. 


‚Ä¢ Subclassing Client class. 

```python

from fbchat_muqit import Client, Message, ThreadType
import asyncio
# Create a class use Client as base Class
class Test(Client):

    async def onMessage(self, mid, author_id: str, message_object: Message, thread_id, thread_type=ThreadType.USER, **kwargs):

        """you will receive all messenger messages here every time anyone sends messages in a thread (Group/User)"""
        # author_id is message sender ID
        if author_id != self.uid:
            await message_object.reply("Hello! This is a reply")
            await message_object.react("‚ù§Ô∏è")
            # mid is message ID
            await self.sendMessage("Hello", thread_id, thread_type, reply_to_id=mid)


async def main():
    cookies_path = "path to json cookies file"
    bot = await Test.startSession(cookies_path)
    if await bot.isLoggedIn():
        fetch_client_info = await bot.fetchUserInfo(bot.uid)
        client_info = fetch_client_info[bot.uid]
        print("Logged in as", client_info.name)

    try:
        await bot.listen()
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)


# Windows User uncomment below two lines
# if sys.platform.startswith("win"):
#   asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(asyncio.WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy())
asyncio.run(main()) 

```

Save the code and now run it. 

```bash
python3 test.py
```

Now, use another Facebook account to send message to the fbchat_muqit Client account. If everything works properly It should reply and react to the message with an emoji.
