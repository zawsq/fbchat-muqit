> You may still be able to send messages to another User if the that User account is inactive for many years because `end-to-end` encryption is not applied when sending message to those account unless the account is Opened again.

## 🛠️ Installation

pip install fbchat-muqit

```

For the latest development version:

```

## 📙 Documentation

The API is Documented. [Read The Documentation](http://fbchat-muqit.rtfd.io/).

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- A Facebook account (It's safer to use old unused account)
- Facebook account cookies 🍪

## 📖 Usage Example

To login in Facebook you will need Facebook account cookies. Since login via email and password is no longer supported.

To get your Facebook account cookies. First login in your Facebook account and then add [C3C Chrome extension](https://github.com/c3cbot/c3c-ufc-utility) in your browser. Open a your Facebook account in a browser tab and use this extension to get your account cookies. Copy the cookies and save them in a json file. We will use the cookies to interact with Facebook server. We will call this account `Client` account.

A basic example of How to use it.

```python
from fbchat_muqit import Client, Message, EventType

client = Client(cookies_file_path="cookies.json")

@client.event
async def on_message(message: Message):
    # To avoid spam check if sender_id is client's id or not
    if message.sender_id != client.uid:
        # echo the message
        await client.send_message(message.text, message.thread_id)

client.run()

```

Save the code in file `test.py` and now run the code.

```bash
python3 test.py
```

If It logins succesfully then Use another Facebook account to create a messenger group and add both of the accounts to the group. Now, send message to the group and fbchat_muqit Client account will listen to all incoming messages and events. If everything works properly It should reply and react to the message sent by your other account with an emoji.
